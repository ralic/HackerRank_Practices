/**

 * <p>
 * See the USB 1.1 specification sec 5.3.2 for details on USB pipes.
 * This pipe is a 'logical' pipe.  It maintains a state (open, closed, busy, etc)
 * and its 'lifetime' is from device connection to device removal.
 * UsbPipes and {@link javax.usb.Request Requests} are the only methods
 * of communication with a UsbDevice.  Each pipe is connected to a specific endpoint
 * on a device (Control-type pipes are 'special', they are connected to 2 endpoints
 * with the same number - and descriptor - with different 'direction' bits).  Data
 * flows in the direction specified by the associated endpoint (except for Control-type
 * pipes, which specifiy the direction as part of each submission).
 * <p>
 * No guarantee of synchronization is made.  If synchronization is desired it should be
 * provided by the application.  However, the implementation may use synchronization and
 * may actually be Thread-safe; but it is not guaranteed.
 * <p>
 * This pipe's configuration and interface setting must be active to use this pipe.
 * Any attempt to use a UsbPipe belonging to an inactive configuration or interface setting
 * will throw a NotActiveException.
