	 * See the USB 1.1 specification table 11.8 offset 7.
	 * Since the number is 1-based, the first port on a hub

	 * on a single hub (so the maximum port number is also 255).
	 * Note that the port number is one greater
	 * than its index in its 'parent' UsbHub's getUsbPorts() list.
	 * Also, the port number is actually an <strong>unsigned</strong>
	 * byte; however Java does not provide unsigned bytes, so
	 * any port number above 127 will appear negative.
	 * To convert this byte into an unsigned integer you can use
	 * {@link javax.usb.util.UsbUtil#unsignedInt(byte) UsbUtil}.
	 * @return the number of this port.
	 * @see javax.usb.util.UsbUtil#unsignedInt(byte)
