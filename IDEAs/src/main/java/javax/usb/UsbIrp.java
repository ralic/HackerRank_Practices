/**
 * Defines a USB Irp (I/O Request Packet).
 * <p>
 * Some USB communication requires addiitonal metadata that describes how the actual
 * data should be handled when being transferred.  This UsbIrp encapsulates the
 * actual data buffer, as well as other metadata that gives the user more
 * control and knowledge over how the data is handled.
 * <p>
 * At a minimum, this can be submitted after its data is set.  If no
 * other changes are made to the UsbIrp then the submission will behave
 * exactly as if the data was submitted by
 * {@link javax.usb.UsbPipe#syncSubmit(byte[]) UsbPipe.syncSubmit(byte[] data)} or
 * {@link javax.usb.UsbPipe#asyncSubmit(byte[]) UsbPipe.asyncSubmit(byte[] data)}.
 * <p>
 * See the USB 1.1 specification sec 5.3.2 for some details on their description of Irps.
 * The Irp defined in this API has more than is mentioned in the USB 1.1 specification;
 * all extra fields or methods are guaranteed to be provided on all platforms, either
 * in the Java subsystem implementation or by the native USB implementation.
