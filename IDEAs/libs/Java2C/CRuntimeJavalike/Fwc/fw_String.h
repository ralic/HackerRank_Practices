/**CLASS_C_Description: The ,,struct StringJc,, is the same as ,,struct OS_PtrValue,,. A StringJc consists of a reference and the number of chars.
 * But the value may contain also an index for enhanced referencing. 
 * Therefore the value is mask with some special bit definitions:
 * * mLength__StringJc: mask for bits for length. The bits are arranged in the low-bits always. 
 * * mNonPersists__StringJc: 
 * This bit definitions are contained  in the include-file ,,fw_Platform_conventions,,, which is included here. 
 * The user can fine-adjust the maximum of length for Strings there.
 *
 * Some methods are ''basicly''. This methods and ,,define,, are defined in a ''framework''-context and not in the ''CRuntimeJavallike''-Library.
 * This elements are defined in this headerfile and they are named as ,,Fw-String,,-class for UML-representation of C-Code.
 * The basicly elements are able to use independend of all other features of the CRuntimeJavalike, they are independend simple C constructs 
 * with no other dependencies. Therefore there are able to use in a operation system adaption layer or in a operation system implementation too.
 *
 * A character string itself, representated in a char-array is named as ''text'' in the description parts of this headerfile. 
 * A ''text-literal'' is a construct written in C like ,,"textliteral",,. 
 * It is stored in machine code commonly in a const memory area and can be referenced by a ,,char const*,,. 
 * Where a instance of ,,StringJc,, references such an text. The type ,,StringJc,, consists of the pointer to the text, its length
 * and some other bits, especially the ''persistent''-bit.
 *
 * Notation hint: The notation ,,char const*,, is the same as ,,const char*,,, but it expresses more stronly, that it is a const-pointer.
