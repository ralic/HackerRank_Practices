 * @version 0.93
 * @content Definition of String processing Java-like
 *   Note: The included file Fwc/fw_String.h contains the definition of the type StringJc
 *   and basicly access macros. If any routines from the Fwc-Level (Framework C)
 *   uses this type to reference a character field with given length, it need not include 
 *   the full definitions given here, but only the basicly things.
 *
 *   This file contains the definitions for enhanced methods of StringJc 
 *   and the CLASS_C StringBuilderJc.
 *
 * list of changes:
 * 2010-04-04 Hartmut: Fully revised. A description of working with Strings in german language were written
 *        see www.vishia.org/Jc/String_Jc.html         
 *   chg: The class StringBufferJc is now named 'StringBuilderJc', it is adequate java.lang.StringBuilder.
 *        To support downward compatibility, a #define StringBuffer... is added.
 *   new: setTruncateMode..() and wasTruncated..(..). The concept of truncated versus exception
 *   chg: Some obsolte and old methods are removed:
 *        
 * 2009-10-30 Hartmut:
 *   new: transsubstantiateToStringBuffer_StringJc(...) now extern defined,
 *   chg: struct StringBufferJc contains element 'mode' for designation _mTemporary_StringBufferJc.
 *   new: ctorM_i_StringBufferJc(...)
 *   new: setTemporary_StringBufferJc(YTHIS)
 *   corr: All accesses to element count in defines regard mLength__StringJc
 *   chg: Renaming of methods, the Java-typical type-chars and their enhancements for reflection-fields are used:
 *     insert_sII_StringBufferJc instead insert_sii_StringBufferJc
 *     insert_C_StringBufferJc instead insert_c_StringBufferJc
 *     replace_zI_StringBufferJc instead replace_z_StringBufferJc
 *     replace_zI_StringBufferJc instead replace_z_StringBufferJc
 *     etc, some insert--methods are defined with its replace counterpart.
 * 2009-02-05: Hartmut new: capacity_StringBufferJc
 * 2008-12-00: Hartmut a lot of changes, not documented yet.
 * 2004-05-00: Hartmut creation

/**CLASS_C_Description: The type StringJc is defined in ,,fw_String.h,,. 
 * It is the same as ,,struct OS_ValuePtr,, from the OSAL level (Operation System Adaption Layer). 
 * That type is designed to represent a structure, which is returned by value in 2 registers.
 * Because it is defined in the compiler- and system-specific headerfile ,,os_types_def.h,,,
 * it can and should be adapted to the target system conditions independently of user programming.
 *
 * Because the feature of representation of a struct in registers, the usage of return per value 
 * and typically call per value for the type StringJc is possible and proper.
 *
 * The headerfile ,,Fwc/fw_String.h,, defines the type and some basicly functionalities
 * to use a StringJc-instance in a low independent level to refer a text..
 * This headerfile against that defines the typically String functionality,
 * which followes the [[sunJavadoc/java/lang/String]] class-functinality. 
 * But some enhancements are given, because the string processing in fast real time embedded systems
 * may work without dynamically memory too.
 *
 * A character string itself, representated in a char-array is named as ''text'' in the description parts of this headerfile. 
 * A ''text-literal'' is a construct written in C like ,,"textliteral",,. 
 * It is stored in machine code commonly in a const memory area and can be referenced by a ,,char const*,,. 
 * Where a instance of ,,StringJc,, references such an text. The type ,,StringJc,, consists of the pointer to the text, its length
 * and some other bits, especially the ''persistent''-bit.

/**A StringBuilderJc is a structure to manage char[]-arrays. 
 * It is derivated and adapted from the content of the java.lang.StringBuffer rsp. java.lang.StringBuilder.
 * Some Java-like methods are supplied, but not all, but some methods are additional 
 * and specifical for usages in C or C++.
 *
 * There are 2 forms of memory layout of this struct:
 * * a) The struct StringBuilderJc contains only the count, size and the pointer of the char[...]-buffer.
 * * b) The struct contains the char-buffer itself.
 *
 * The first variant is usefull especially if a C-like text buffer (char* with given size) is located anywhere
 * in the users data structures, and the StringBuilderJc-instance is only used temporary to assemble the text in the buffer.
 *
 * The last variant is possible either if a construct like
 *
 * , struct { StringBuilderJc b; char _b[46];} myBuilder = 
 * ,   CONST_addSizeStack_StringBuilderJc(&buffer.b, 50);
 *
 * is defined and initialized or if the [[ctorO_StringBuilderJc(...)]]-Constructor is called 
 * with an initialized ObjectJc with a size greater than sizeof(StringBuilderJc). It means more memory was allocated.
 * That variant needs only 1 memory block for the buffer management and the buffer itself.
 *
 * The StringBuilderJc-instance holds some flags such as ''located in the Thread Context'' or ''buffer is located in Stack''
 * and ''truncated'', see the appropriate methods. The internal attributes of this struct should not use immediately,
 * only the methods of this C-class should be used.
 *
 * '''Problem of reallocating a buffer''': In Java it's some more easier: Working with dynamically memory is usual, 
 * and the buffer is a private element of the StringBuilder. Therefore the buffer can be changed anytime, 
 * only a few amount of calculation time is need.
 *
 * But in C the StringBuilderJc is often associated with a determined buffer of the user. The user shows to its buffer,
 * The StringBuilder-instance is only a helper to deal with the content. A situation, that an unexpected overflow of the buffer size
 * occurs during an append operation, than the StringBuilder swaps the content in a new allocated buffer, will be a confusion.
 * The user looks to its buffer, no content is changed, why? He doesn't look to the StringBuilder-Instance.
 *
 * Because on other side the handling with dynamically memory is restricted often in C-applications, the reallocation of buffer
 * is only suitable by calling the method ,,ensureCapacity,,. This method is not supported in this version, but it may be supported.
 * Than the user is responsible to the correctness of handling with its old buffer. If the user ensures actively, it should look what it means.
 * If the [[BlockHeap]] or an adequate mechanism with equal-size-blocks are used for dynamically memory-management, 
 * a new allocated buffer has the highest size of block which are possible in the system. So an enhancement of capacity is not possible.
 * The system limit of equal size blocks are decisive anyway. An increasing is not possible, because the highest size is given anyway.
 *
 * The allocation is not limited in startup-phase using [[BlockHeap]], but in a startup phase the allocated memory is used
 * as fix memory on runtime. An accidental buffer for a String-building is not desired mostly.  
 *
 * Therefore the concept is: An enhancement of content never changes the buffer. 
 * Either an exception is thrown (to detect maybe an error of given conditions) or an truncation is done.
