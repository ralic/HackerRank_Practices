 * @content: This file contains all methods from CRuntimeJavalike which have access to the operation system level.
 * Only the routines here uses the os_wrapper.h and are dependent on it. All other routines are os-independent.
 * The os_wrapper.h defines the interface to the operation system in a os-independently way.
 * But the os_wrapper.h may be adapted to os-requirements in the future. So only this source is involved.
