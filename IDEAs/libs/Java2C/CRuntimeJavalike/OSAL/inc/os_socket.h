 * @content This header describes an interface for socket communication, 
 *          which supplies operation-system-independent calls. The using software is portable.
 *          The socket communication is defined as a quasi-standard similar in most of the operation systems,
 *          but few differences prevent a compatible usage. Therefore a wrapper is nice to have.
 *          The implementation of this routines are the wrapper to the special operation system.
 * @version 0.93
