    This interface is usefull for reporting something (logfiles). It should be used in every algorithm routine
    to support debugging without using an extra debugger. It may help to encircle problems.

date       who       change
2007-12-29 HartmutS  some methods from mainCmd_ifc are displaced here. 
                     Thus the Report interface is revalued to write some informations also to the display
                     with the capability to control the report levels for that in the implementation.
