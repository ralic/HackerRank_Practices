/**This class helps to handle with special chars in Strings.
 * In Java all Strings are encoded with UTF-16. But in Files the encoding is mostly implemented
 * with 1 byte per char. Different encodings are used, ISO-8859-1 is typical for windows systems,
 * but also UTF-8. To write special chars in any desired encoding, some systems are ordinary.
 * In programming, the backslash is used to switch to special char codes, typically \\n for new line.
 * In XML the system of special character codes starts with an ampersand, typically
 * &amp; for the &-character itself.
 * 
 * This class supports the backslash-philosophy to indicate special character codes.
