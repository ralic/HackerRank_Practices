## spring-controllers

This project contains samples on how to use [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX)
to test an entire JavaFX application (as opposed to an isolated GUI component).

In particular, the JavaFX applications in this subproject use
the Spring Framework to wire the client applications together.

### Running the tests

Navigate to the root of this subproject,
then use the Gradle wrapper to build and run tests:

- `cd samples/spring-controllers`
- `gradle build`

### Running the application

- `gradle bootRun`
